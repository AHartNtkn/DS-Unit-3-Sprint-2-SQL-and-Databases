What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and what is a situation where it is not appropriate?

  Generally, a document store is appropriate when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data. Due to  its ability to prototype quickly, it may also be appropriate in some situations with a time limit where technical debt isn't as much of a concern. Such stores are less appropriate when dealing with structured data, or when issues related to database reliability, consistency, durability, etc are more of a concern.
